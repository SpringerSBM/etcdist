# TODO
* think about / improve error handling (for example: write operation is not atomic)
* gemspec: specify required ruby version

## Lower priority
* feature: **optionally** remove directories from etcd if no longer present
* feature: do not process directories that don't have any modified files
* feature: provide etcdist as a binary so that it can be executed from the command line.
