# TODO
* feature: dry-run / diff
* think about / improve error handling (for example: write operation is not atomic)
* replace 'Patric Fornasier' with 'Springer'
* gemspec: specify required ruby version
* gemspec: link to homepage (i.e. bitbucket)
* check licence

## Lower priority
* feature: **optionally** remove directories from etcd if no longer present
* feature: do not process directories that don't have any modified files
* feature: provide etcdist as a binary so that it can be executed from the command line.
