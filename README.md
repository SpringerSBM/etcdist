# Etcdist

This is a small gem that helps you manage your etcd keys and values in a way that's easy to version control.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'etcdist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install etcdist

## Usage

### Create the config data

Create your desired directory structure. This will be replicated in etcd. For example:

```shell
mkdir -p config/foo/bar
```
    
Then create a file in the leaf directory containing the keys and values that you want to go into etcd. For example:    

```shell    
cat <<EOT > config/foo/bar/food.config
fish=plankton
cows=grass
EOT
```    

The name of the file containing the keys and values doesn't matter. In fact, you can split the configuration into multiple files, if you want. An example would look like:

    ./config
    └── ./foo
        └── ./bar
            ├── food.config    # contains fish=plankton and cows=grass
            └── more.config    # could contain more keys and values
            
### Populate etcd

Then pass the path to your config data directory to Etcdist. For example:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'etcdist'
config_dir = '.../config'
Etcdist.execute(config_dir)
```

### Configuration

#### Etcd host

```ruby
Etcdist.execute(config_dir) # defaults to localhost:4001
Etcdist.execute(config_dir, host: '127.0.0.1', port: 4003)
```

#### Log level

You can control the log level, as follows:

```ruby
Etcdist::Log.level = :info
```
